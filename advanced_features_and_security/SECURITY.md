# Security Enhancements in Django

## 1. HTTPS Enforcement
- Enabled `SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT` to redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS.
- Configured `SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS`, `SECURE_HSTS_INCLUDE_SUBDOMAINS`, and `SECURE_HSTS_PRELOAD` for strict HTTPS usage.

## 2. Secure Cookies
- Set `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE` and `CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE` to prevent cookie theft over insecure connections.

## 3. Secure Headers
- Implemented `X_FRAME_OPTIONS = 'DENY'` to prevent clickjacking.
- Enabled `SECURE_CONTENT_TYPE_NOSNIFF` to avoid MIME-type sniffing attacks.
- Enabled `SECURE_BROWSER_XSS_FILTER` to mitigate XSS risks.

## 4. Deployment Configuration
- Installed SSL certificates using Let's Encrypt.
- Configured Nginx to enforce HTTPS and redirect HTTP to HTTPS.

## 5. Future Improvements
- Implement Content Security Policy (CSP).
- Use HTTP security scanning tools for continuous monitoring.
